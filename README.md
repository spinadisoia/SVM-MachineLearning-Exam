# SVM_MachineLearningExam
My exam for my Bachelor's degree Machine Learning exam

This constitutes my project for the Machine Learning and Data Analysis course as part of my Bachelor's degree in Mathematical Statistics and Data Management. The examination entailed developing a Machine Learning algorithm using a dataset of my choosing.
The purpose of my project is to contemplate the selection of hyperparameters and the choices of kernels for Support Vector Machine algorithms. The models derived are not optimal, especially within the domain under analysis.
